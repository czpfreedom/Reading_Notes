# Chapter 1-10

​    Upon signing out, I cast around for some place in the New England countryside or sleepy small town (elms, white church) where I could spend a studious summer subsisting on a compact boxful of notes I had accumulated and bathing in some nearby lake. My work had begun to interest me again—I mean my scholarly exertions; the other thing, my active participation in my uncle’s posthumous perfumes, had by then been cut down to a minimum.

​    One of his former employees, the scion of a distinguished family, suggested I spend a few months in the residence of his impoverished cousins, a Mr. McCoo, retired, and his wife, who wanted to let their upper story where a late aunt had delicately dwelt. He said they had two little daughters, one a baby, the other a girl of twelve, and a beautiful garden, not far from a beautiful lake, and I said it sounded perfectly perfect.

​    I exchanged letters with these people, satisfying them I was housebroken, and spent a fantastic night on the train, imagining in all possible detail the enigmatic nymphet I would coach in French and fondle in Humbertish. Nobody met me at the toy station where I alighted with my new expensive bag, and nobody answered the telephone; eventually, however, a distraught McCoo in wet clothes turned up at the only hotel of green-and-pink Ramsdale with the news that his house had just burned down—possibly, owing to the synchronous conflagration that had been raging all night in my veins. His family, he said, had fled to a farm he owned, and had taken the car, but a friend of his wife’s, a grand person, Mrs. Haze of 342 Lawn Street, offered to accommodate me. A lady who lived opposite Mrs. Haze’s had lent McCoo her limousine,
a marvelously old-fashioned, square-topped affair, manned by
a cheerful Negro. Now, since the only reason for my coming at
all had vanished, the aforesaid arrangement seemed
preposterous. All right, his house would have to be
completely rebuilt, so what? Had he not insured it
sufficiently? I was angry, disappointed and bored, but being
a polite European, could not refuse to be sent off to Lawn
Street in that funeral car, feeling that otherwise McCoo
would devise an even more elaborate means of getting rid of
me. I saw him scamper away, and my chauffeur shook his head
with a soft chuckle. En route, I swore to myself I would not
dream of staying in Ramsdale under any circumstance but would
fly that very day to the Bermudas or the Bahamas or the
Blazes. Possibilities of sweetness on technicolor beaches had
been trickling through my spine for some time before, and
McCoo’s cousin had, in fact, sharply diverted that train of
thought with his well-meaning but as it transpired now
absolutely inane suggestion.

Speaking of sharp turns: we almost ran over a meddlesome
suburban dog (one of those who lie in wait for cars) as we
swerved into Lawn Street. A little further, the Haze house, a
white-frame horror, appeared, looking dingy and old, more
gray than white—the kind of place you know will have a
rubber tube affixable to the tub faucet in lieu of shower. I
tipped the chauffeur and hoped he would immediately drive
away so that I might double back unnoticed to my hotel and
bag; but the man merely crossed to the other side of the
street where an old lady was calling to him from her porch.
What could I do? I pressed the bell button.

A colored maid let me in—and left me standing on the mat
while she rushed back to the kitchen where something was
burning that ought not to burn.

The front hall was graced with door chimes, a white-eyed
wooden thingamabob of commercial Mexican origin, and that
banal darling of the arty middle class, van Gogh’s
“Arlésienne.” A door ajar to the right afforded a glimpse
of a living room, with some more Mexican trash in a corner
cabinet and a striped sofa along the wall. There was a
staircase at the end of the hallway, and as I stood mopping
my brow (only now did I realize how hot it had been out-ofdoors)
and staring, to stare at something, at an old gray
tennis ball that lay on an oak chest, there came from the
upper landing the contralto voice of Mrs. Haze, who leaning
over the banisters inquired melodiously, “Is that Monsieur
Humbert?” A bit of cigarette ash dropped from there in
addition. Presently, the lady herself—sandals, maroon
slacks, yellow silk blouse, squarish face, in that order—
came down the steps, her index finger still tapping upon her
cigarette.

I think I had better describe her right away, to get it
over with. The poor lady was in her middle thirties, she had
a shiny forehead, plucked eyebrows and quite simple but not
unattractive features of a type that may be defined as a weak
solution of Marlene Dietrich. Patting her bronze-brown bun,
she led me into the parlor and we talked for a minute about
the McCoo fire and the privilege of living in Ramsdale. Her
very wide-set sea-green eyes had a funny way of traveling all
over you, carefully avoiding your own eyes. Her smile was but
a quizzical jerk of one eyebrow; and uncoiling herself from
the sofa as she talked, she kept making spasmodic dashes at
three ashtrays and the near fender (where lay the brown core
of an apple); whereupon she would sink back again, one leg
folded under her. She was, obviously, one of those women
whose polished words may reflect a book club or bridge club,
or any other deadly conventionality, but never her soul;
women who are completely devoid of humor; women utterly
indifferent at heart to the dozen or so possible subjects of
a parlor conversation, but very particular about the rules of
such conversations, through the sunny cellophane of which not
very appetizing frustrations can be readily distinguished. I
was perfectly aware that if by any wild chance I became her
lodger, she would methodically proceed to do in regard to me
what taking a lodger probably meant to her all along, and I
would again be enmeshed in one of those tedious affairs I
knew so well.

But there was no question of my settling there. I could not
be happy in that type of household with bedraggled magazines
on every chair and a kind of horrible hybridization between
the comedy of so-called “functional modern furniture” and
the tragedy of decrepit rockers and rickety lamp tables with
dead lamps. I was led upstairs, and to the left—into “my”
room. I inspected it through the mist of my utter rejection
of it; but I did discern above “my” bed René Prinet’s
“Kreutzer Sonata.” And she called that servant maid’s room
a “semi-studio”! Let’s get out of here at once, I firmly
said to myself as I pretended to deliberate over the
absurdly, and ominously, low price that my wistful hostess
was asking for board and bed.

Old-world politeness, however, obliged me to go on with the
ordeal. We crossed the landing to the right side of the house
(where “I and Lo have our rooms”—Lo being presumably the
maid), and the lodger-lover could hardly conceal a shudder
when he, a very fastidious male, was granted a preview of the
only bathroom, a tiny oblong between the landing and
“Lo’s” room, with limp wet things overhanging the dubious
tub (the question mark of a hair inside); and there were the
expected coils of the rubber snake, and its complement—a
pinkish cozy, coyly covering the toilet lid.

“I see you are not too favorably impressed,” said the
lady letting her hand rest for a moment upon my sleeve: she
combined a cool forwardness—the overflow of what I think is
called “poise”—with a shyness and sadness that caused her
detached way of selecting her words to seem as unnatural as
the intonation of a professor of “speech.” “This is not a
neat household, I confess,” the doomed dear continued, “but
I assure you [she looked at my lips], you will be very
comfortable, very comfortable, indeed. Let me show you the
garden” (the last more brightly, with a kind of winsome toss
of the voice).

Reluctantly I followed her downstairs again; then through
the kitchen at the end of the hall, on the right side of the
house—the side where also the dining room and the parlor
were (under “my” room, on the left, there was nothing but a
garage). In the kitchen, the Negro maid, a plump youngish
woman, said, as she took her large glossy black purse from
the knob of the door leading to the back porch: “I’ll go
now, Mrs. Haze.” “Yes, Louise,” answered Mrs. Haze with a
sigh. “I’ll settle with you Friday.” We passed on to a
small pantry and entered the dining room, parallel to the
parlor we had already admired. I noticed a white sock on the
floor. With a deprecatory grunt, Mrs. Haze stooped without
stopping and threw it into a closet next to the pantry. We
cursorily inspected a mahogany table with a fruit vase in the
middle, containing nothing but the still glistening stone of
one plum. I groped for the timetable I had in my pocket and
surreptitiously fished it out to look as soon as possible for
a train. I was still walking behind Mrs. Haze through the
dining room when, beyond it, there came a sudden burst of
greenery—“the piazza,” sang out my leader, and then,
without the least warning, a blue sea-wave swelled under my
heart and, from a mat in a pool of sun, half-naked, kneeling,
turning about on her knees, there was my Riviera love peering
at me over dark glasses.

It was the same child—the same frail, honey-hued
shoulders, the same silky supple bare back, the same chestnut
head of hair. A polka-dotted black kerchief tied around her
chest hid from my aging ape eyes, but not from the gaze of
young memory, the juvenile breasts I had fondled one immortal
day. And, as if I were the fairy-tale nurse of some little
princess (lost, kidnaped, discovered in gypsy rags through
which her nakedness smiled at the king and his hounds), I
recognized the tiny dark-brown mole on her side. With awe and
delight (the king crying for joy, the trumpets blaring, the
nurse drunk) I saw again her lovely indrawn abdomen where my
southbound mouth had briefly paused; and those puerile hips
on which I had kissed the crenulated imprint left by the band
of her shorts—that last mad immortal day behind the “Roches
Roses.” The twenty-five years I had lived since then tapered
to a palpitating point, and vanished.

I find it most difficult to express with adequate force
that flash, that shiver, that impact of passionate
recognition. In the course of the sun-shot moment that my
glance slithered over the kneeling child (her eyes blinking
over those stern dark spectacles—the little Herr Doktor who
was to cure me of all my aches) while I passed by her in my
adult disguise (a great big handsome hunk of movieland
manhood), the vacuum of my soul managed to suck in every
detail of her bright beauty, and these I checked against the
features of my dead bride. A little later, of course, she,
this nouvelle, this Lolita, my Lolita, was to eclipse
completely her prototype. All I want to stress is that my
discovery of her was a fatal consequence of that “princedom
by the sea” in my tortured past. Everything between the two
events was but a series of gropings and blunders, and false
rudiments of joy. Everything they shared made one of them.

I have no illusions, however. My judges will regard all
this as a piece of mummery on the part of a madman with a
gross liking for the fruit vert. Au fond, ça m’est bien
égal. All I know is that while the Haze woman and I went down
the steps into the breathless garden, my knees were like
reflections of knees in rippling water, and my lips were like
sand, and—

“That was my Lo,” she said, “and these are my lilies.”

“Yes,” I said, “yes. They are beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful!”
