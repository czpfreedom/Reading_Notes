# Chapter 1-1

​    Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins[^ 1]. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate[^ 2] to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta. 

​    She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, standing four feet ten in one sock. She was Lola in slacks[^ 3]. She was Dolly at school. She was Dolores on the dotted line[^ 4]. But in my arms she was always Lolita.

​    Did she have a precursor[^ 5]? She did, indeed she did. In point of fact, there might have been no Lolita at all had I not loved, one summer, a certain initial girl-child. In a princedom by the sea. Oh when? About as many years before Lolita was born as my age was that summer. You can always count on a murderer for a fancy[^ 6] prose[^ 7] style.

​    Ladies and gentlemen of the jury[^ 8], exhibit number one is what the seraphs[^ 9], the misinformed[^ 10], simple, noble-winged seraphs, envied. Look at this tangle[^ 11] of thorns[^ 12].
